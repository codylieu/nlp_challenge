# NLP Challenge

At ScopeAI we are all about leveraging nlp to help our customers better understand their customer texts. This is where you come in.

### The goal
Use your favorite word2vec model in combination with your favorite classification algorithm to predict sentiment of movie reviews. The emphasis is on combining the two and overall code quality rather than fine tuning of the algorithm for superior accuracy.

### Data
There are 3 txt files with IMDb movie reviews: postive, negative and unsupervised. Feel free to use (or not use) these any way you see fit to test your code. We leave splitting into training and testing sets to you.

### Expected Output
We expect your code to break the samples into training and testing and then output a classification accuracy level to the console, however, everything else is for you to decide. You might want to add some visualisation or sensitivity analysis.

Please submit your solution via a Github repo. If that's not possible - a zip file. Send the link to nlp@getscopeai.com

Add a README.md file explaining your process. It can be in a format of a short blog post, report or a tutorial. Any cool insight you find along the way, or cool tool you use will be a bonus. The file should contain full instructions on what we need to do to get to the output.

### Notes
* You should be able to complete the project within a few hours, not days.
* Feel free to work in whatever language / framework you are most comfortable in but we prefer Python for ML tasks.
* Feel free to use any machine learning or deep learning library like Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch or another one but do not use their built-in solutions for sentiment analysis if they have them.
* You can use `spacy` or `gensim` for word vectors.
* Please focus on making the code clear and modular, rather than on the complexity of the solution. Accuracy level itself will not be a success factor as much as our understanding of what you are doing and why. Treat your code as if it will be deployed to production.

### Bonus Points
* Clear, readable code
* Good naming of methods
* Being able to concisely explain what you have done and why certain decisions have been made
* Use of a deep learning model

### Get in touch
* If something isn't clear, feel free to submit an issue to this repo or drop us an email at nlp@getscopeai.com
